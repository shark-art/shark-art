# Adaptive Knowledge-Graph based Recommender with User's Cross-Item-Category Exploration Factor

This is our PyTorch implementation for the paper:

## Environment Requirement

The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:

- pytorch == 1.8.1
- numpy == 1.19.5
- scipy == 1.1.0
- sklearn == 0.20.0
- torch_scatter == 2.0.9
- networkx == 2.5

## Dataset

We provide three processed datasets: Movielens, Last-FM, and Alibaba-iFashion.

## Example to Run the Codes

You can run the .py file directly, using the following command to run the model:

$ python main.py
